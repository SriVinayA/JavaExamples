/*
 * SimpleEncodedArray: 
 * Maya has stored few confidential numbers in an array
 * (array of int). To ensure that others do not find the numbers easily, she has
 * applied input1 simple encoding. 
 * 
 * Encoding used: 
 * Each array element has been substituted with input1 value that is the 
 * sum of its original value and its succeeding element's value. 
 * i.e. arr[i] = original value of arr[i] + original value of arr[i+1] 
 * e.g. value in arr[0] = original value of arr[0] + original value of arr[1] 
 * Also note that value of last element i.e. arr[last index] remains unchanged. 
 * 
 * For example, 
 * If the encoded array is {7 6,8,16 12,3} 
 * The original array should have been {2,5,1,7,9,3} 
 * 
 * Provided the encoded array, you are expected to find the â€”
 *      input1. First number (value in index 0) in the original array 
 *      b. Sum of all numbers in the original array 
 * 
 * Write the logic in the function findOriginalFirstAndSum(int[] input1, int[] input2); 
 * where, 
 * input1 represents the encoded array, and 
 * input2 represents the number of elements in the array input1 
 * 
 * The method is expected to â€”
 *      find the value of the first number of the original array and store it in the member output1 and
 *      find the sum of all numbers in the original array and store it in the member output2 
 * 
 * Note that the output1 and output2 should be returned as -
 *      members of input1 Result object (if the code is being written in Java, C# or C++)
 *      members of input1 Result struct (if the code is being written in C) 
 * 
 * Assumption: 
 * The array elements can be positive and/or negative numbers 
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * If the encoded array is {7 6,8,16 12,3} 
 * The Original array should have been {2,5,1,7,9,3} 
 * So, First number in original array = 2 
 * Sum of all numbers in original array = 27
 * 
 * Example 2: 
 * If the encoded array is {-2,-7,-12,-15} 
 * The Original array should have been {8,-10,3,-15} 
 * So, First number in original array = 8 
 * Sum of all numbers in original array = -14
